Welcome to my Melloc read me.
melloc is a  memory allocation in c
and it falls under the dynamic memery allocation:
SHORT NOTES:
      the compiler allocates the memory for the programmer's requirements
      the memory under the DMA can  be modified during run time
      memory is allocated from heap
      use a pointer to access the memory in Heap segment
      AND AT  LAST its your responsibility to free the memory once you are done.
      syntax for malloc:
			void* malloc(size * sizeof(type of any data)
			      type of any dataa can be>>
				      	  	        int DT
							char DT
							float DT

		          THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
